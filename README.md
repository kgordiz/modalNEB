## Overview

This repository contains tools for running, analyzing, and visualizing **modal NEB (Nudged Elastic Band)** calculations, particularly for studying ion migration and phonon mode coupling in solid-state materials. It provides a robust workflow that leverages both Python and MATLAB for:
- Automated simulation setup and data generation (Python)
- Advanced post-processing and scientific visualization (MATLAB)

The **theoretical framework and scientific results** from this work are published in:
- [A modal analysis of lithium diffusion in solid electrolytes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666386421001260), *Cell Reports Physical Science* (2021)
- [A general atomistic framework for computing modal contributions to migration barriers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01632), *arXiv preprint* (2023)

## Features

- **Batch Processing:** Automated analysis across multiple simulation folders.
- **Flexible Analysis:** Extracts, computes, and compares atomistic projections, energy contributions, and mode participation.
- **High-Quality Visualization:** Generates publication-quality figures, using MATLABâ€™s advanced plotting capabilities.
- **Hybrid Workflow:** Python for data generation and simulation, MATLAB for post-processing and visualization.
- **Fully Scriptable:** Easily adaptable for different systems and simulation types.

## Workflow

1. **Simulation Setup & Execution (Python):**
   - Organize and run NEB simulations for different ion hopping pathways using scripts in the main `modalNEB/` package.
   - Each simulation produces a set of output text files (e.g., `ev.txt`, `phonon_contribs_discrete_LLTO.txt`, etc.) in subfolders for each pathway.

2. **Data Collection & Post-Processing (MATLAB):**
   - Use the MATLAB script in `/analysis/matlab/` to batch process all simulation results.
   - The script reads data from each folder, computes atomic and modal contributions, projects phonon modes, and calculates quantities such as migration barriers and energy decompositions.
   - Advanced batch plotting produces a range of customizable, publication-ready figures (elemental decomposition, mode-resolved histograms, and more).

3. **Result Interpretation:**
   - Analyze the outputs for trends in ion migration, the role of different phonon modes, and elemental contributions.
   - Visualize frequency-resolved and atom-resolved contributions to migration barriers.
