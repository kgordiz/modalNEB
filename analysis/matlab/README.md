# MATLAB Post-Processing Scripts

This folder contains MATLAB scripts for batch post-processing and visualization of modal NEB (Nudged Elastic Band) simulation outputs.  
These scripts are designed to work with the output folders generated by the main Python package (`modalNEB/`).

---

## Usage

1. **Prepare your data:**  
   Place all output folders (each corresponding to a hopping pathway) from the Python simulations in the same directory as the MATLAB script, or update the `foldernames` variable in the script to point to your data.

2. **Run the script:**  
   Open the `.m` file in MATLAB and run it.  
   The script will automatically read the output files from each simulation, compute relevant quantities, and generate a range of publication-quality figures.

3. **Outputs:**  
   - Plots are shown in MATLAB figures (can be saved/exported as needed).
   - Calculated quantities (migration barriers, contributions, etc.) can be exported by modifying the script.

## Script Description

- `<your_postprocessing_script>.m`:  
  Main script for loading simulation results, processing data, and generating figures as described in [modalNEB README](../../README.md).

---

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2023b or later recommended.
- Standard MATLAB toolboxes (no special dependencies).

## Example Input Data

*(Optional: Provide a link to example data, or a brief description of expected folder/file structure.)*
